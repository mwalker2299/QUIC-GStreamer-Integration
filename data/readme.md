## Data

`processed_data` contains the final data (graphs) produced using the raw data.

As the raw data is far too big (500GB), I have not included it. However, I have included an example of a small subset of results in `raw_data`

`scripts` contains the scripts used for analysis. You will need to edit the functions at the bottom of `analyser.py`
if you wish to run the analyser on some test results you produced after running the framework.
