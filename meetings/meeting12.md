* Evaluating the Effectiveness of QUIC When Integrated Into Gstreamer
* Matthew Walker
* 2310528
* Dr Colin Perkins





## Minutes:

* Updated Colin on my chosen loss parameters. He felt i should widen the scope. See Parameter_Notes.md for the results of this discussion.
* Described status of QUIC stall issue on high loss runs. Got logging  working, it looks like we are getting stuck during recvmsg but the socket is non-blocking so this seems unlikely
* Discussed network systems course breifly.
