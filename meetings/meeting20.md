# Meeting Conducted at 14:00 on 16/03/22

* Evaluating the Effectiveness of QUIC When Integrated Into Gstreamer
* Matthew Walker
* 2310528
* Dr Colin Perkins


## Status Report

* Wrote up second draft of dissertation
* Create Frame per second QUIC element
* Possible problem with initial tests but could be promising research opportunity

## Minutes:

- Application layer of QUIC is not universally beneficial. Companies like Apple who can easily roll out kernel updates would find this less beneficial. Developers who need their products to work on multiple OS with differing support would benefit from a transport protocol that they can freely control.
- Other codes use Nal units.
- Move related work to after design rationale and comment on difference in approach
- Describe motivation for the research before diving into background
