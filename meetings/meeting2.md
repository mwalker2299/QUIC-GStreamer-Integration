# Meeting Conducted at 15:30 on 07/10/21

* Evaluating the Effectiveness of QUIC When Integrated Into Gstreamer
* Matthew Walker
* 2310528
* Dr Colin Perkins


## Status Report

* Performed research further research into QUIC, GStreamer and Mininet to create plan/requirements.
* Created requirements for project and a plan
* This differs from the original project outline which had issues related to work load.
* Project requirements and plan were provided to supervisor.

## Questions

* What did supervisor think of new plan? (rather than create two new elements, create a src element only and upgrade the existing tcpclientsrc element)
* The new plan differs slightly from the original project summary listed on the project system. Is this an issue?
* Can we take advantage of QUIC streams when downloading media files from a server.
* Will the makeup of media files impact data transfer.
* Can mininet simulate nat rebinding?

* Would interop matrix be too costly time wise.
