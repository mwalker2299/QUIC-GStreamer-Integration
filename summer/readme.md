# Summer work

* Evaluating the Effectiveness of QUIC When Integrated Into Gstreamer
* Matthew Walker
* 2310528
* DR. Colin Perkins

## Research completed

* Looked into GStreamer development and visualisation tools.
* Read IETF documents describing QUIC
* Read a number of papers discussing the features of QUIC
* Read a number of papers decribing issues with TCP

## Ideas developed

* Developed an idea with my manager at Consult Red to develop a GStreamer pipeline analysis tool. However, during research it was discovered that a suitable tool already existed.
* Developed an idea with DR. Colin Perkins involving the integration of QUIC into GStreamer in order to evaluate QUIC within GStreamer in anumber of use cases

## Concerns or risks identified

* Developing GStreamer plugins can take a lot of effort. My only concern is that this will leave me less time for evaluation and dissertion writing.
